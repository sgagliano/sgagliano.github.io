#### Position Openings! <b>Come join us in Montréal!</b>
We are seeking highly-motivated graduate students and postdoctoral research fellows to join our computational lab located at the Montréal Heart Institute affiliated with the Université de Montréal (UdeM).
UdeM is a French-speaking University, but our lab operates in English. Knowledge of both languages is an asset.
