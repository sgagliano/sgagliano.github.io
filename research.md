### Research Summary
My research interests are to (1) identify and better understand genetic contributors for complex traits to help detect targets for more effective treatment options, particularly for disorders of the brain, and (2) integrate and interpret summary-level single-variant association data from thousands of traits collected as part of phenome-wide scans of genetic variants to reveal key mechanistic insights for further exploration. I tackle these problems from a biological perspective using statistical and computational tools. Both arms of research use rich sets of “big data” in silico, and involve cross-disciplinary collaborative efforts across genomic, epigenomic, and health datasets. This work will increase knowledge on the genetic aetiology of complex traits to allow for earlier and better diagnoses, and the potential to support personalized treatments and novel therapies.
