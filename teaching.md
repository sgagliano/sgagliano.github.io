### Teaching Summary
As researchers, I believe it is our responsibility to transmit our's and others' research to the broader community.
I take this responsibility to heart, and I really enjoy teaching to a wide-range of indivduals, and I challenge myself to meet their diverse skillsets. Here are selected examples, I: 
* volunteered as a mentor for <b>high school students</b> through the Ontario Online Research Co-op program, 
* supervised a group of <b>undergraduate students</b> in the six-week Big Data Summer Institute at the University of Michigan, and
* co-instructed <b>graduate-level</b> human genetics courses at the University of Michigan

### Writing

In addition to <a href="{{site.url}}/research"> research</a> and teaching, I like to make time for my other passion: passing on information through writing. I enjoy writing about scientific and non-scientific topics.
