I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan.
My <a href="{{site.baseurl}}research"> research</a> involves identifying and better understanding genetic contributors for complex traits, particularly disorders of the brain, by making use of rich sets of “big data” in silico. 
My goal is to increase knowledge on the genetic aetiology of complex diseases to allow for earlier/better diagnoses and personalized treatment, and transmit this information through <a href="{{site.baseurl}}teaching"> teaching</a>.
